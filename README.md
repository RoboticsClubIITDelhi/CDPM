## 🤖 Project Overview

This repository houses the codebase for the Cable Driven Parallel Manipulator. It serves as a comprehensive collection of resources including research, calculations, code, CAD models, and component datasheets. Our aim is to create a well-documented reference that will enable future teams to build upon our work.

### 🎯 Design Goals
- ✅ Robust Design(Stability while operating)
- ✅ Stable Gripper for gripping objects
- ✅ Precise Inverse Kinematic calculations
- ✅ Fast operation


## 🧠 Algorithm Development
The Inverse Kinematics depends on the final configuration of cables, number of motors used and the mechanism used. Algorithms for Inverse Kinematics will be a novelty for this project.
